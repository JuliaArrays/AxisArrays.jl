# Promotion rules for "promiscuous" types like Intervals and SIUnits, which both
# simply wrap any Number, are often ambiguous. That is, which type should "win"
# -- is the promotion between an SIUnit and an ClosedInterval an SIQuantity{ClosedInterval}
# or is it an ClosedInterval{SIQuantity}? For our uses in AxisArrays, though, we can
# sidestep this problem by making Intervals *not* a subtype of Number. Then in
# order for them to plug into the promotion system, we *extend* the promoting
# operator behaviors to Union{Number, ClosedInterval}. This way other types can
# similarly define their own extensions to the promoting operators without fear
# of ambiguity -- there will simply be, e.g.,
#
# f(x::Number, y::Number) = f(promote(x,y)...) # in base
# f(x::Union{Number, ClosedInterval}, y::Union{Number, ClosedInterval}) = f(promote(x,y)...)
# f(x::Union{Number, T}, y::Union{Number, T}) = f(promote(x,y)...)
#
# In this way, these "promiscuous" types will never interact unless explicitly
# made subtypes of Number or otherwise defined with knowledge of eachother. The
# downside is that Intervals are not as useful as they could be; they really
# could be considered as <: Number themselves. We do this in general for any
# supported Scalar:
const Scalar = Union{Number, Dates.AbstractTime}
Base.promote_rule{T<:Scalar}(::Type{ClosedInterval{T}}, ::Type{T}) = ClosedInterval{T}
Base.promote_rule{T,S<:Scalar}(::Type{ClosedInterval{T}}, ::Type{S}) = ClosedInterval{promote_type(T,S)}
